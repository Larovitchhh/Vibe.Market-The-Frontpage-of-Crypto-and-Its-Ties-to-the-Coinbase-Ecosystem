The platform frequently tags and engages with Coinbase leadership, such as CEO Brian Armstrong (@brian_armstrong
) and Base creator Jesse Pollak (@jessepollak
), in discussions about investments and potential collaborations. For instance, posts speculate on whether Coinbase might "overinvest" in competing protocols like Farcaster or Zora, while highlighting Vibe.Market's unique position. Community members have called for official announcements, like a "Vibe Market pack" from Pollak or Coinbase, underscoring hopes for deeper integration.Vibe.Market operates on Base, leveraging its infrastructure for pack trading and liquidity. This alignment positions it within Coinbase's push for onchain commerce and distribution, where Base serves as a settlement layer for global activities.
