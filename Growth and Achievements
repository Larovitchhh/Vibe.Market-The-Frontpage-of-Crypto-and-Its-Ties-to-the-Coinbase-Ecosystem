 As Base's ecosystem expands, Vibe.Market positions itself as a gateway for retail users into onchain gaming and collectibles, potentially influencing broader Coinbase-driven adoption. Future growth may involve more cross-protocol collaborations, but its token-free model keeps the focus on sustainable creator support.
